# Service Recommendation System Improvements - Summary

## Problem Statement

The current service recommendation system has two main issues:

1. It shows service recommendations too frequently, even when users are not explicitly asking for advice.
2. It uses a fixed cooldown period for all services, which doesn't allow for service-specific cooldown periods.

## Solution

We've implemented the following changes to address these issues:

### 1. Created a Modular Advice Detection System

- Created `advice_patterns.js` with a focused list of explicit advice request patterns in Japanese
- Created `adviceDetector.js` with functions to detect explicit advice requests and extract matching patterns

### 2. Updated the Service Recommendation Trigger

The service recommendation trigger in `server.js` has been updated to only show recommendations when:
- User preferences allow it (existing condition)
- The user explicitly asks for advice using one of the predefined patterns (new condition)

### 3. Enhanced the Cooldown System

The `wasRecentlyRecommended` method in `serviceRecommender.js` has been updated to:
- Use service-specific cooldown periods from the service data
- Fall back to the default cooldown period if a service-specific one is not defined
- Add detailed logging for better transparency and debugging

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `advice_patterns.js` - Contains explicit advice request patterns
   - `adviceDetector.js` - Provides functions to detect advice requests
   - `README.md` - Instructions for implementing the changes
   - `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

2. **Files to Modify:**
   - `server.js` - Update the `detectAdviceRequest` function and service recommendation trigger
   - `serviceRecommender.js` - Update the `wasRecentlyRecommended` method

### Integration Steps

1. Add the new files to the project
2. Update the existing files as described in the README.md
3. Test the changes to ensure they work as expected
4. Commit and deploy to Heroku

## Expected Benefits

1. **More Precise Advice Detection:**
   - Only show service recommendations when users explicitly ask for advice
   - Reduce unwanted recommendations

2. **Improved User Experience:**
   - Less intrusive service recommendations
   - Better alignment with user expectations

3. **Service-Specific Cooldowns:**
   - Different services can have different cooldown periods
   - More fine-grained control over recommendation frequency
   - Better user experience by avoiding repetitive recommendations

4. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Better visibility into the recommendation decision process
   - Easier debugging and monitoring

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Verify that service recommendations are only shown when a user message contains one of the explicit advice request patterns
2. Verify that different services respect their specific cooldown periods
3. Check the logs to ensure the enhanced logging is working correctly
