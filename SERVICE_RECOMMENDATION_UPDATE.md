# Service Recommendation System: Technical Update

## Overview of Recent Changes

This document outlines the recent improvements to the service recommendation system, focusing on enhanced user feedback handling and category-based filtering.

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced User Feedback Detection

The system now has an improved ability to detect and respond to user feedback about service categories:

- Added the `preferredCategory` field to the `presentationContext` object to track user preferences explicitly
- Enhanced keyword detection with additional terms for each category:
  - Career: Added 'お仕事' to existing keywords
  - Mental Health: Added '心理' to existing keywords
  - Social: Added 'コミュニケーション' to existing keywords
  - Financial: Added '財政' to existing keywords
- Expanded the list of negation patterns for better feedback detection
- Added positive pattern detection to identify when users are specifically asking for certain categories

### 2. Improved Category Prioritization

The system now prioritizes service categories more intelligently:

- Created a category grouping system that organizes services by type
- Implemented a priority selection algorithm that respects user feedback
- Added special case handling for explicit phrases like "お仕事関係ない" (not work-related)
- Improved ranking of services based on user needs analysis and explicit feedback

### 3. Two-Stage Filtering Process

The recommendation process now uses a two-stage filtering approach:

1. **First Stage**: Filter services based on confidence score and user preferences
2. **Second Stage**: Group services by category, prioritize the relevant category, and build a final list that respects user preferences

### 4. Code Structure Improvements

The changes include significant refactoring for maintainability:

- Better separation of concerns between filtering, categorization, and presentation
- More detailed logging to help with debugging
- Simplified service presentation code with clearer organization
- Improved error handling for edge cases

## Configuration Options

No new configuration options were added as part of this update. The system continues to use the following key files:

- `server.js`: Contains the main service recommendation logic
- `serviceRecommender.js`: Handles the matching process
- `services.js`: Defines the available services and their criteria

## Testing Results

The update has been tested with several critical user scenarios:

1. **Mental Health Scenarios**: System now correctly prioritizes mental health services when users mention mental health issues
2. **Negative Feedback Cases**: System properly filters out rejected categories when users provide negative feedback
3. **Multi-Category Needs**: System correctly balances recommendations across different need areas

## Deployment Notes

The update has been deployed to Heroku. No database changes or migrations were required. The changes are backward compatible with existing features.

## Monitoring Recommendations

We recommend monitoring the following log entries to validate the system's behavior:

- `Detected positive interest in category: [category]`
- `Detected negative feedback for category: [category]`
- `Prioritizing [category] services based on user feedback and needs`
- `Filtering out service [id] due to negative feedback for category [category]`

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for the next iteration:

1. Add more sophisticated natural language understanding to detect subtle feedback
2. Implement a feedback learning mechanism to improve recommendations over time
3. Create a more dynamic category detection system that can adapt to emerging patterns
